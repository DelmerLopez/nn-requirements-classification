# nn-requirements-classification

This repository contains the code written to conduct the experimentation phase of the thesis project on Software Requierements Classification using a Neuroevolutive Approach.

The phases of the experimentation are:

1. Making a handcrafted Neural Network (nn-experiments)
2. Making a neuroevolutive scheme to evolve a neural network (neuroevolution)
3. Comparison of both approaches with reduced characteristics dataset (reduced-experiments)
4. Comparison of both approaches with balanced datasets (balanced-experiments)

## Dataset

The dataset contains 630 vectorized requirements previously preprocessed in [this repo](https://github.com/quality-attributes/text-representation). The dataset includes seven classes which are not balanced.
